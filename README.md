# about
This project consists on making user requests to GithubAPI and return 
the user profile and the repos with (name and description) \
I could not use any UIlibrary for styling for example bootstrap

## Used teck packages and choices i made
- The Boilerplate from npx create react app \
- react-router-dom used for routing \
- node-sass for using scss and scss.modules \
- we have a styles folder with a generic.scss, another _custom.scss to spread and reutilize. Each component that need it has its owen .module.scss file. It gives the capability for the classes to be unike
- @reduxjs/toolkit & react-redux for state management creting the app/store.js and a Provider spreading the state trought the store
- The store.js can have multiple slices as for this test is has the githubSlice and also added middleware for cache collection, automatic refetching, etc witch cames from features/api/githubApijs
- The githubApi.js is were all happens regarding the fetching api. This great tool provides us hooks:
- useGetUserNameMutation - to fetch the user and than is added to the store state with useDispatch and we get data from the store with the useSlice
- useGetUserReposQuery - for fetching the user repositorys
- githubSlice - we have the initialState and the reducer to getUser() /
Also is great because it is using Immer to help developers with immutable state based 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
